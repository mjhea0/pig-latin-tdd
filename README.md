## Pig Latin: JavaScript Test Driven Development

Why? because it's fun.

### TDD?

1. write a test, and watch it fail
2. write code that should pass the test
3. run the test, then refactor the code (if necessary)

### Instructions

1. Add tests to "spec.js" (think about the rules for pig latin)
2. Run tests by opening "spec-runner.html" in your browser
3. Add code to "scripts.js"

### Results
